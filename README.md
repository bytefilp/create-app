# React Starter

React Stater is a combination of Vite + React + TS + N project scaffold.

Why do I need it? 

**Every time we create a new React project, we have to do some combination and configuration over and over again, which is quite time-consuming.**

How is it different from [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and [umi](https://github.com/umijs/umi) ?

**We only do a combination of various popular tool libraries in the React ecosystem.**

You may be wondering, can't I build it myself? Of course, you can do it.

I'll talk about its use in two ways.

1. For project maintainers
   - Familiar with front-end engineering related knowledge.
   - Explore project technology selection.
   - Accumulate projects and make technical pavement for other projects in the future.
2. For project users
   - Choose any combination and use it right out of the box. Saves you the time of doing it yourself.
   - Refer to the partial configuration and customize the items to meet the requirements.
   - Other `Tips` that you may not have come across.
   - Points that you think will help you.
